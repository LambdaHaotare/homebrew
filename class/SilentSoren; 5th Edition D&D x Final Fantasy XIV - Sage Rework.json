These magical stones form the basis of Sage's greatest tools the Nouliths, a collection of 4 enhanced adderstones controlled by an anchor stone the sage holds, allowing them to control and position the adderstones as an extension of their mind, weaving magic sigils to heal and harm."

Once a sage has begun this path they are often driven forward with the intent to protect others and bring succor to the world and its people. Be it heroic quests, mastery of their arts or the removal of those that would do harm, sage's are usually forces for good."
